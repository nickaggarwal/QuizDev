<p>Ever wish you could get your students to stop texting and use their
  phones productively in the classroom? Or want to gauge what your students have
  learned? This Android app and related systems enables educators to engage and
  challenge their students inside the classroom (using polls) and outside the
  classroom (using quizzes).</p>
<h2>How it works</h2>
<p>With Quiz & Poll, teachers &amp; educators can create quizzes and polls
  easily using Google Spreadsheets. Quizzes and Polls are distributed to
  students via the Android app or an embeddable webplayer. Statistics data is
  written back to the spreadsheet so the instructor can track student responses
  and understanding.</p>

<strong>Key Features:</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Quizzes and polls are easily created and administered on Google
    Spreadsheets.</li>
  <li>Students can download the Android App to take the quiz or live
    classroom poll.</li>
  <li>For students without Android phones, quizzes and polls can be
    accessed via a web interface (works on laptops, iPhones, iPads etc.).</li>
  <li>Administrators can view quiz and poll statistics on the same
    Spreadsheet.</li>
</ul>
